# 🚍 Real-Time Bus Tracking System  

A real-time bus tracking system developed in **R**, where live GPS coordinates of buses are streamed on **Google Maps**. The system consists of a backend that simulates buses moving along predefined routes and a frontend that updates the map every few seconds.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ Simulates buses moving along predefined routes  
✅ Provides real-time GPS coordinates via an API  
✅ Visualizes live bus locations on **Google Maps**  
✅ Updates the bus positions dynamically every few seconds  
✅ Built using **Shiny**, **Plumber**, and **Leaflet/Google Maps API**
